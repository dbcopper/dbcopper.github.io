## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. My research focuses on computer vision, multimodal learning, and few-shot learning, with applications in agriculture. I explore the use of large language models and agent systems for crop disease diagnosis, crop phenotyping, and intelligent decision support. My work aims to integrate advanced AI techniques with agricultural data to enhance precision farming and sustainable crop management.
