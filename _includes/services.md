  <li>Extracted human pose and segmentation maps via OpenCV to guide image generation through ControlNet</li>
  <li>Designed prompt engineering strategies to control clothing type, texture, and style with high consistency</li>
  <li>Fine-tuned LoRA models to preserve facial identity and generate user-specific outfit variations</li>
  <li>Developed a full pipeline integrating image preprocessing, diffusion-based generation, and post-processing (edge enhancement, background blending)</li>
  <li>Achieved significantly improved realism and structural alignment compared to baseline generation methods</li>
</ul>
