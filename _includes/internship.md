## Internship Experience

<h4 style="margin:0 10px 0;">Large Language Model Intern, Ant Group Co., Ltd.</h4>

<ul style="margin:0 0 5px;">
  <li>Contributed to RLHF fine-tuning of a text-to-image generation model, focusing on Reward Model design and optimization</li>
  <li>Developed a reward model to align image generation outputs with human aesthetic preferences</li>
  <li>Built reward signals using human preference data, CLIP-based scoring, and learning-to-rank
approaches</li>
  <li>Improved generation quality with noticeably higher aesthetic appeal, validated by human evaluations</li>
  <li>Collaborated closely with cross-modal and model training teams to iterate on reward signal strategies and deployment</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin:0 10px 0;">AIGC Intern – Virtual Try-On, Turing Flash Innovations Co., Ltd.</h4>
<ul style="margin:0 0 5px;">
  <li>Built a virtual try-on system using Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, and LoRA for personalized outfit generation</li>
  <li>Extracted human pose and segmentation maps via OpenCV to guide image generation through ControlNet</li>
  <li>Designed prompt engineering strategies to control clothing type, texture, and style with high consistency</li>
  <li>Fine-tuned LoRA models to preserve facial identity and generate user-specific outfit variations</li>
  <li>Developed a full pipeline integrating image preprocessing, diffusion-based generation, and post-processing (edge enhancement, background blending)</li>
  <li>Achieved significantly improved realism and structural alignment compared to baseline generation methods</li>
</ul>
